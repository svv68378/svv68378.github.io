		<P>From the ripe age of <small>ten years old</small> I began my infatuation with the world-renowned boy band <I>One Direction</I>. This Web Page will be describing some of the things I still have stored in my brain about these men, whom I still support to this day. The indiscriminate hiatus that these men went on six years ago has still not put a stopper on my love, nor hindered me from continuing to obsess over them.
